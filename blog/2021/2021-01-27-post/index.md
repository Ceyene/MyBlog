## Far away, beyond the mountains of words...

away from the countries of vowels and consonants, live simulated texts. They live isolated in houses of letters, on the coast of semantics, a great ocean of languages.
A stream called Pons flows through their town and supplies them with the necessary standards. We are talking about a paraisomatic country in which pieces of roasted phrases fall into one's mouth. Not even all-powerful punctuation marks dominate mock texts; a life, you can say, little spelling.

But one fine day, a little line of mock text, called Lorem Ipsum, decided to venture out into the vast world of grammar.

### The great Oxmox discouraged him from doing so...

as those lands were littered with:

- evil commas,
- wild question marks,
- treacherous semicolons

but the mock text was not put off.

He packed up his seven versalis, slipped his initial on his belt, and set off. When he had already scaled the first foothills of the cursive mountains, he turned to direct his gaze for the last time, towards his hometown Wordland, the heading of the Alphabet town and the subtitle of his own street, the street of the line.

A rhetorical question crossed his mind and made him melancholic, but he immediately started walking again.
