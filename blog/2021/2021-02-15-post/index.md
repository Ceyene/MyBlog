## Pangram:

The exhausted mouth wants vine, kiwi, pineapple and fleeting ham. Fabio openly demands that I add beer to the whiskey. Whiskey-poisoned youngster, what a figure you display! The stork played the saxophone better and better and the owl asked for kiwi and cheese. The chief sought ecstasy in an unforeseen whiskey bath and rejoiced like a duke. Show off coarse politicians, with long ears and hawk nails. The corpse of Wamba, the Gothic king of Spain, was exhumed and transferred in a zinc box that weighed one kilo. The Wenceslas penguin made kilometers under exhausting rain and cold, he longed for his beloved cub.

### The swift Hindu bat was happily eating baby gourd and kiwi.
